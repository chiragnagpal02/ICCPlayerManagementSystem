# ICCPlayerManagementSystem

This is a high school project developed to automate the 
functionalities of a user friendly cricket database. 
The purpose of this software project is to write a 
program which provides a user friendly interface to explore the history of cricket along with its top players and important matches.

The program mainly brings forth the usage of python 
programming along with database management system of mySQL. 
The program was made to work over a network and provide 
unlimited ways of interaction between the user and the store, 
some of which are demonstrated in this project in the form of the output.

The mySQL database mainly consists of the players's names, scores, centuries, top accolades, bowler economies, averages etc. along with a small engaging game for the user. 
Python program works to connect with the mySQL database 
to give the user the ability to filter out specific plaeyrs (on the basis 
of scores, previous results etc.) or to play the game.
